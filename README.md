Introduction
------------

Like its original incarnation in the early 2000s, TrueCurve for IceWM is based
on the BlueCurve Metacity theme originally released with Red Hat 9.0. While
there are several other BlueCurve clone themes for IceWM this is my attempt to
perfectly mimic the original Red Hat design - something which I believe the
others have failed to achieve.

The window decorations are as close to identical as I can make them; all other
artwork is my own, with the exception of the default folder and application
icons which are from the GNOME 2 default icons and RedHat's BlueCurve artwork
respectively, and Tux and Hexley on the alternative start button (Tux is of
course the brilliant logo designed by Larry Ewing, albeit somewhat shrunken in
this instance).

In the 1.1.0 release, all window decorations were redrawn and, deriving from the
original Red Hat design, a stripe pattern was added to the window decorations.
Window controls were also redrawn to give it a cleaner look. Rounded borders were
also removed in interest of screen space.
